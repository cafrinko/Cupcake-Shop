        <p class="intro">At Space Cakes we pride ourselves in offering cupcakes with the highest quality of ingredients (whole grain flours milled in-house, grass-grazing animal products), widest range of options for dietary preferences (omnivore, vegetarian, vegan) and most economical price: FREE! Yes, we gift our cupcakes to our space cadet patrons for free because we are doing this side-gig for fun and to build community. We actually fund ourselves quite heartily with web development day-time jobs. To offset the effects of our gentrifying your neighborhood by moving tech into it, we would like to give back by offering our product for free.</p>
